desc: "ThreeJS to visualize all Openforge STL models in the browser. DevonJohnes the owner and designer of OpenForge already uploads the models in thingiverse but it's very laggy and 0 friendly to navigate around all the design so I decide to develop a little app to make it easy. In a future I want to automate when Devon uploads a new file and develop a dungeon planning."
